Eggstream Defense is an engaging tower defense game developed during my internship at Mindstorm Labs. The game's objective is to protect precious dragon eggs from various enemy waves across multiple challenging levels. Featuring tower defense gameplay, players must strategically place defensive units to thwart waves of enemies advancing towards the dragon eggs, while encountering different enemy types such as swordsmen, archers, and bombers, each with unique behaviors and abilities. As the game progresses, the dragon gains power-ups like electric balls and meteoroids to aid in defending the eggs against increasingly formidable foes. Face escalating challenges through multiple levels, requiring strategic planning and adaptability to succeed. Contribute to Eggstream Defense by suggesting new features, reporting bugs, or submitting improvements. Clone the repository, compile and run the game executable, follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through levels, and defend the dragon eggs by strategically deploying defensive towers and utilizing power-ups effectively.
